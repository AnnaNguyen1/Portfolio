# Anna Nguyen's Portfolio

## Website

Welcome to my Github Portfolio repo.

As a Full Stack Developer student, I have created a portfolio to showcase skills gained and projects I've created so far. This page will continuously be updated to include my latest work.

Resume and other contact details are attached, therefore feel free to drop by to say hi!

HTML and CSS was used to create the deployed application on Github.
