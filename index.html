            <p class="about-me-content">Hello, my name is Anna, and I enjoy solving problems that consists of code! My interest in web development started when I joined BGL as a software support consultant, back in 2015. I had a little taste of coding during my years as a tester and business analyst and decided to branch my career in that direction.<br> I have had a fruitful career, worked as a Nail Technician while finishing my degree in Bachelor of Accountancy in 2012 and became a Chartered Accountant (CA) in 2019. I am currently employed at BGL as a Product Manager, managing Corporate Compliance Desktop Software. <br>I've seen many parts of the world, but the world of 0's and 1's is highly fascinating.</p>
